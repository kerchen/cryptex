(Optional) Some ISPs don't properly handle failed DNS lookups; Google's do.
If your Windows box is unable to connect to .local addresses or they take
a long time to serve up HTTP requests, or you can't use the normal HTTP port
(80) without your ISP trying to "help" you, you might need to set your network
adapter settings so that they use Google's:
* For IPv4: 8.8.8.8 and/or 8.8.4.4.
* For IPv6: 2001:4860:4860::8888 and/or 2001:4860:4860::8844.

Steps for using Adafruit 2.2" TFT (non-touch)
1. Grab Adadruit Jessie-based PiTFT 2.2" HAT image from https://s3.amazonaws.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi/2016-10-18-pitft-22.zip
   Detailed instructions at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-2-pitft-hat-320-240-primary-display-for-raspberry-pi/easy-install

2. Burn image to SD card. Put wpa_supplicant.conf in root dir if you want to
   be able to use a WiFi adapter for the configuration steps.
3. Connect hardware:
  a. Connect TFT to Pi
  b. Connect USB hub to non-power USB connector on Pi. Connect keyboard,
  mouse, and WiFi dongle (unless you want the frustration of trying to edit
  files, etc on a tiny display).
4. Connect USB cable to power USB port on Pi; connect other end to PC.
   This should cause the Pi to boot.
5. Once Pi is up, configure avahi per https://elinux.org/RPi_Advanced_Setup#Setting_up_for_remote_access_.2F_headless_operation
6. Change locale, etc to US: sudo raspi-config
  a. Select "5. Internationalisation Options" -> Change Locale
     i. Select en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
     ii. Un-select en_GB.UTF-8 UTF-8
     iii. Select <Ok>
     iv. When prompted, select "en_US.UTF-8" as default locale for system environment
  b. Select "5. Internationalisation Options" -> Change Locale
     i. Select "Generic 101-key PC" 
     ii. Select <Ok>
     iii. Select "Other" for keyboard layout
     iv. Find "English (US)" in list, select it, and then select <Ok>
     v. Use plain English keyboard (no dvorak, etc)
     vi. Use defaults for remaining options
7. Escape from config program. Verify that typing shift-3 gives you a '#'
character and not the British pound symbol.
8. Set up USB gadget support:
  a. Edit /boot/config.txt and add this line to the end of the file:
     dtoverlay=dwc2
  b. Edit /etc/modules and add these lines to the end of the file:
     dwc2
     libcomposite
  c. Add this line to rc.local:
     /home/pi/switch-mode.sh rndis
9. At this point, you're ready to ditch the WiFi dongle. n.B. Avahi doesn't
  seem to work with WiFi(?). You should probably install anything that
  requires hitting an external server now.
  a. Shut down the Pi and disconnect the USB hub.
  b. Remove wpa_supplicant.conf from root of SD card.
  c. Reconnect the USB cable to the non-power USB connector on the Pi (the
     other end is still connected to host PC).
10. Change console font size (optional) and turn off screen blanking:
  a. Edit /boot/cmdline.txt.
     i. Add 'consoleblank=0' to the end of the line
     ii. Change boot font to desired value (e.g., Terminus10x20)
  b. Change font size for post-boot:
     i. Run 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup'
     ii. Select font and size as desired
          Font name                   Display Size (in characters)
          Terminus6x12                53x20
          Terminus8x14                40x17
          Terminus8x16                40x15
          Terminus10x20               32x12
          Terminus11x22               29x10
          Terminus12x24               26x10
          Terminus14x28               22x8
          Terminus16x32               20x7
          TerminusBold10x20           32x12
